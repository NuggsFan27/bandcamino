# The Band Camino
The Band CAMINO Website Redesign is a fan-focused project showcasing the band’s music, tour dates, and interactive experiences. Built as a creative UX portfolio piece, the site reimagines how fans engage with discography, visuals, and mini-games — blending music appreciation with playful interactivity.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This redesign emphasizes fan interaction and immersive aesthetics. Inspired by The Band CAMINO’s modern pop-rock sound, the visual identity combines warm orange accents with sleek dark tones. Rounded album cards and hover overlays give an energetic but polished feel. The interactive mini-game and toggle modes enhance engagement and accessibility, showing how playful design can coexist with functional usability. The layout was refined from initial wireframes to maintain strong visual hierarchy and flow.

## Features


Dynamic discography section with hover overlays revealing tracklists and streaming links

Tour Dates page listing upcoming shows by city and date

Interactive mini-game (number-guessing Easter egg) coded in JavaScript

Media gallery for videos, fan photos, and behind-the-scenes content

## Lessons Learned:

Working how to implement elements of Javascript into my website. Adding hoverig effects and the toggle to light/dark mode was tricky but helpful to find out. 

## Examples:
